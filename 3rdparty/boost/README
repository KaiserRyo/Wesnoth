Instructions for building the full Boost libraries should be found at 
https://github.com/blackberry/Boost. However, they may not be available yet.
Here are some temporary quick instructions for building the parts of Boost 
that Wesnoth requires.
1. Download Boost. (http://www.boost.org/)
2. You will need to build two libraries and also have the full headers
   available to Wesnoth.
3. Extract the downloaded archive file to this directory.
4. The include path for Wesnoth should already include this directory, correct
   it if needed.
5. Create two new NDK projects. Choose C++ and have them build static libraries.
   One should be called libboost_iostreams and the other libboost_regex.
   i. a. For libboost_iostreams, copy the source files from libs/iostreams/src
         into the project src directory.
      b. Set up the include path to point to the 3rdparty/boost directory in 
         the wesnoth project.
      c. Build the library.
   ii. a. For libboost_regex, copy the source files from libs/regex/src
         into the project src directory.
      b. Set up the include path to point to the 3rdparty/boost directory in 
         the wesnoth project.
      c. Build the library.
6. Change the wesnoth project to link against the two new library projects.
   This will probably require you to change the library paths.
