Build Instructions
1. Download Glib source from http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/sources/glib/.
   These instructions were actually tested against 2.28.8.
2. The directory layout used for the project is somewhat different from
   the layout in the archive. (FIXME for later!) 
   However, here's what you need to do.
   a. First, extract the glib-2.28.8 folder contents into this directory. You
      should have a number of subdirectories (e.g. glib, gmodule, gobject).
   b. Move four of these subdirectories (glib, gmodule, gobject and gthread)
      into the src folder.
   c. Copy three header files (glib-object.h, glib.h and gmodule.h) into the
      inc folder. These are the public includes for the library.
      - glib-object.h and glib.h are found in the src/glib directory.
      - gmodule.h is found in the src/gmodule directory.
   d. Edit two files.
      - src/glib/gmain.c: PlayBook does not have the SA_RESTART flag. It will
        suffice for now to remove it. It occurs only once. You can #ifdef it
	if you wish. __PLAYBOOK__ is an acceptable macro.
      - src/glib/libcharset/localcharset.c: There is no charset.alias file
        so we need to act as if we were VMS. In the 
	_g_locale_get_charset_aliases function, there are two places where 
	we check if VMS is defined. Add checks for __PLAYBOOK__ in the same
	places. This will define the charset aliases safely.

3. Import the NDK project from this directory into your workspace.
4. Build the project.
