Build Instructions
1. Download Cairo source from http://cairographics.org/download. This was
   tested against 1.10.2.
2. When extracting the source into this directory, please *be careful* to copy
   the src folder into this directory instead of creating a cairo-1.10.2 
   directory here. Note that there is already a src folder present which 
   contains generated files for the build.
3. Import the NDK project from this directory into your workspace.
4. Build the project.
